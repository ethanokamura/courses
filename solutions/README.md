# Solutions Directory

This directory contains the complete working solutions for the programs within the courses. These solutions are provided for reference after you attempt the exercises on your own.

## Structure
- Each solution file corresponds to the respective template in the `templates` directory.
- File names match those in the `templates` directory for easy reference.

## Usage
1. Compare your implementation with the solution after attempting the exercise.
2. Use the solutions to understand best practices and optimize your code.
3. Avoid referring to solutions before making a genuine attempt at solving the exercises.
